how to contribute


Stan is open source because we want your input to help make
Stan's code and documentation better.

# Suggest or Discuss Code Patches

To suggest or discuss small patches, such as localized bug fixes, the users group
is the best venue.  For larger patches, the discussion should move to
the developers group.


# Contribute Code Patches

If you'd like to contribute code, please submit it through a Git
pull request.  The developer process for creating a Git pull request
is described on the Stan Wiki.

* <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Developer-Process">Developer
    Process Wiki</a>
  <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>
  </p>

After code review, testing, and merging, all code is distributed
under the same open-source license of the package to which it
belongs (GPL for RStan, PyStan; BSD for CmdStan, C++ API; CC
BY for documentation).



# To Do List and Projects

Larger project design documents and goals, as well as the
developer process followed by Stan, are listed in various places on:

* <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki">Stan Wiki</a>
  <span class="note">(on GitHub)</span>
  </p>

There is a top-level list that is in the process of being moved
over to the issue tracker.

# Join the Development Team

The Stan development team is always looking for developers
willing to get their hands dirty with C++, R, or Python design,
coding, documentation, testing, and maintenance.

The current list of bugs and feature requests we would like to
implement is available on the interface-specific [issue
trackers](/issues/).

If you'd like to join the development team and gain push access
to the Stan code repository, please let us know by first requesting
to join the [developers group](/community/).
Please include a brief description of your programming background
and what you'd like to contribute.

# Source Repositories

Stan's source is managed through the [Git](http://git-scm.com) version
control system and hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com).  All of the
source repositories, including the math library, Stan's core API
(language and inference), and all of the interfaces, add-ons, and
example models are listed here:
