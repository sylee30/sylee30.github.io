## A Primer on Bayesian Multilevel Modeling using PyStan

<small>
This case study replicates the analysis of home radon levels using
hierarchical models of [Lin, Gelman, Price, and Kurtz
(1999)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~radon/credits.html).  It
illustrates how to generalize linear regressions to hierarchical models with
group-level predictors and how to compare predictive inferences and
evaluate model fits. Along the way it shows how to get data into Stan
using pandas, how to sample using PyStan, and how to visualize the results
using Seaborn.

## Reparameterization: MLE vs. Bayes

<small>
When changing variables, a Jacobian adjustment needs to be provided to
account for the rate of change of the transform.  Applying the
adjustment preserves the probability distributions of quantities of
interest, thus making Bayesian inference invariant to
reparameterizations.  In contrast, the maximum likelihood estimate
(posterior mode) is changed when the distribution-preserving Jacobian
adjustment is included for a parameter.  In this note, we use Stan to
code a repeated binary trial model parameterized by chance of success,
along with its reparameterization in terms of log odds in order to
demonstrate the effect of the Jacobian adjustment on the Bayesian
posterior and maximum likelihood estimate.  Along the way, we derive
the logistic distribution by transforming a uniformly distributed
variable.

## Two-Parameter Logistic Item Response Model

<small>This tutorial introduces the R package edstan for estimating
two-parameter logistic item response models using Stan without knowing
the Stan language. Subsequently, the tutorial explains how the model
can be expressed in the Stan language and fit using the rstan
package. Specification of prior distributions and assessment of
convergence are discussed. Using the Stan language directly has the
advantage that it becomes quite easy to extend the model, and this is
demonstrated by adding a latent regression and differential item
functioning to the model. Posterior predictive model checking is also
demonstrated.</small>

## Pooling with Hierarchical Models for Repeated Binary Trials

<small>This note illustrates the effects on posterior inference of
pooling data (aka sharing strength) across items for repeated binary
trial data.  It provides Stan models and R code to fit and check
predictive models for three situations: (a) complete pooling, which
assumes each item is the same, (b) no pooling, which assumes the items
are unrelated, and (c) partial pooling, where the similarity among the
items is estimated.  We consider two hierarchical models to estimate
the partial pooling, one with a beta prior on chance of success and
another with a normal prior on the log odds of success.  The note
explains with working examples how to (i) fit models in RStan and plot
the results in R using ggplot2, (ii) estimate event probabilities,
(iii) evaluate posterior predictive densities to evaluate model
predictions on held-out data, (iv) rank items by chance of success,
(v) perform multiple comparisons in several settings, (vi) replicate
new data for posterior p-values, and (vii) perform graphical posterior
predictive checks. </small>
