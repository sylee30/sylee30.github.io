The library is header-only, so there is nothing to install.


# Documentation and Getting Started

A simple getting-started example for computing derivatives is provided
in the 

* <p>
  <a href="https://github.com/stan-dev/math/blob/develop/README.md">Stan Math
    Library README</a>.
  </p>

There is a make target to build the API documentation using
[doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) <span
