Bayesian applied regression modeling via Stan

RStanArm allows users to specify models via the customary R commands, where

* <p>models are specified with formula syntax,</p>
* <p>data is provided as a data frame, and</p>
* <p>additional arguments are available to specify priors.</p>

Estimation may be carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo,
variational inference, or optimization (Laplace approximation).
Graphical posterior predictive checking, leave-one-out
cross-validation, and posterior visualization are tightly integrated.
